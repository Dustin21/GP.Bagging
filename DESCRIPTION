Description: Gaussian Process (GP) Regression gained hype in the late 1990's
    for pattern recognition due to the rapid advancement of computational power
    that helped facilitate the implementation of GPs for large data sets.
    Deriving from the family of neural networks and Bayesian non-parametric
    regression, GPs are noted to be quite sensitive to changes in the training
    data causing stability issues. Performing bagging on GPs increases
    prediction stability and accuracy in data that follows a noisy and
    stochastic behaviour (non-deterministic). To my knowledge, there is no
    package to facilitate a bagging procedure on Gaussian Processes. This
    package is a wrapper to a companion function called GPfit.
